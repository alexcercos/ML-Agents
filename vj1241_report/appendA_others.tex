\chapter{Other considerations}

This appendix is included to comment some aspects not considered in the rest of the template and as an example of the format of an appendix.

\section{Bibliography}

All the references to the external documentation used for writing the report (and, therefore, for the realization of the work) should appear in the bibliography. All the bibliography entries should be conveniently referenced on the text.

\section{Appendices}

Technical information of the work must be presented in the Appendices. Technical information refers to: the source code (see Appendix~\ref{sec:codigo_fuente}), the screenshots, the photos of the implemented system, the manuals developed, etc. As a general rule, each of the above kind of materials will result in a separate appendix.
