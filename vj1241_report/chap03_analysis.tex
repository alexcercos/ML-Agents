\chapter{System Analysis and Design}

\minitoc{}

\bigskip{}

In this sections, we will detail which requirements must be acomplished to consider that the neural network solves its task correctly. Also, we will specify the system used to develop this work and its minimum specifications.

\section{Requirement Analysis}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

The following must be fulfilled to provide a realistic imitation:

\begin{itemize}
 \item The neural network will be able to play indepently the game
 \item The network will receive as input what is seeing
 \item The network will receive as input immediate past actions and images
 \item The network will output the action made (continuous actions)
 \item The network will output the probability of performing an action (discrete actions)
 \item The network will adapt its actions to reaction times of who is imitating
 \item The network and the real player would not be differentiated when playing
\end{itemize}

If there is a failure in the collection process, the user is informed of the error.} % description


\subsection{Non-functional Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
 \item The network will be scalable to more complex problems
 \item The network will be decently trained in reasonable time
 \item The network will be sample efficient when training
\end{itemize}


\section{System Design}
\label{sec:system_design}

To train an agent, an environment is needed. The training is executed in a game build, where the custom bot plays the game and the neural network tries to guess its moves. After trained, the neural network can be fed into the Agent class and play the game by itself in the editor. The Figure~\ref{fig:classes} shows the class diagram of the environment:
\begin{figure}[b]
  \centering
		\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{img/classDiagram.png}
  \caption{Class diagram of the training environment}
  \label{fig:classes}
\end{figure}

The scene has one custom Academy (ShootAcademy), a Camera and a Spawner that creates the enemies randomly in execution time. The camera contains one custom bot (the abstract class allows to create new bots and test them without changing references), a movement handler (CameraMovement) which handles the moves made by the bot or the neural network, a custom Agent that generates and executes trained neural networks, a visual sensor and a Demo Recorder (when activated, it generates a dataset for Imitation learning).

The classes Academy, Agent, DemoRecorder and Sensor are provided by the ML Agents SDK~\cite{mlagents}.

\section{System Architecture}

\end{figure}

\section{Interface Design}

To acknowledge how well is the neural net adapting to the bot movement, the guesses of the bot are displayed in a real time graph alongside the bot's real move. There is also a centered sight to better see how the bot behaves. Figure~\ref{fig:uicomp} shows a complete game window while training.

The graph displays 3 main lines (see Figure~\ref{fig:uigraph}): the red one is the move made by the bot, the blue and green ones are the highest and lowest guess of the bot (since the bot's movements are not perfect, these two lines can vary from being almost touching to being really wide). Other 3 lines in the back display the weighted average move and its standard deviation.

The image at the bottom left is what the neural network receives as input. It helps verify that everything works correctly (Figure ~\ref{fig:uivision}).
